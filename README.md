# CS370
Briefly explain the work:
  In this course, we were tasked with working with and developing and intelegent agent that could navigate through a maze to find and land on the objective, and we did this 
  through utilizing nerual networks and Q-learning algorithms to teach the agent how to proceed through the game and learn how to effectively play it. We were initially given 
  the bulk of the game code, that way we could focus on implementing and training the intelligent agent to complete the game.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists look at new ways of using software and technology to solve problems in todays ever changing world, or pushing the limits of software to find ways of 
  improving the solutions that we currently have.
  
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  The way I approach a problem as a computer scientist is I first figure out what the root of the problem is. I then look at the different tools we have at our disposal 
  currently and how I might be able to apply these solutions in creative ways that might not have been used in the past.
  
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical duties are to never create software that leads to the detriment of society. I have to make sure the software I am developing provides a benefit/solution, as opposed 
  to creating problems for people.
